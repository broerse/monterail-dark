# Monterail Dark
_Monterail Dark, a Thunderbird theme inspired by the mockup of Monterail_

## What is this?
This is a full theme for the Thunderbird e-mail client, inspired by [Monterail](https://monterail.com/blog/2016/the-power-of-email-clients-why-did-we-redesign-thunderbird) mockup and by [spymastermatt](https://github.com/spymastermatt/thunderbird-monterail)'s dark theme. As opposed to the spymastermatt's version, this theme can be **installed easily and quickly with an addon** and it's **fully compatible with Thunderbird 60.x**.

## Installation
### Manual (from source)
The first step is to [download](https://github.com/conema/monterail-dark/archive/master.zip) the theme from GitHub and change the extension to ".xpi". An extensive guide for install the xpi file can be found [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird) on the Mozilla support site, starting from "A slightly less ideal case". The Addon Manager can be found by clicking the menu icon ![menu](https://prod-cdn.sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/gallery/images/2017-10-22-15-37-15-18c775.png) (on the right, next to the search bar) followed by Add-ons and click on the Themes panel on the left.

### Theme market (**recommended procedure**)
The theme can be directly downloaded from the Thunderbird Add-on market, it can be found by searching "Monterail Dark" directly in the add-on page of thunderbird or [there](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/monterail-dark/).

## FAQ
* The Light/Full Dark version will be released?

Yes, but for the moment it is better to completely finish the dark version, after that, the creation of other versions will fast as a snap of fingers.

* The original Monterail version will be released?

Nope, it already exists: [Monterail by Paenglab](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/monterail/).

* This theme should work with Windows/Linux/MacOS?

Yes and no. Currently the theme have been tested only on Windows 10 and OpenSuse (Plasma). In theory there should not be problems, otherwise you are free to open an issue here on GitHub.

* With which versions of Thunderbird can I use this theme?

For now only **60.x** is been tested, in the future, backward compatibility to the most requested versions will be added.
